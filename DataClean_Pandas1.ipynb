    "# <u>Objective: Predict if a customer will default on a credit card payment or not</u>\n",
    "### Draft 1\n",
    "## <u> Introduction</u>\n",
    "Credit cards are one of the main sources of revenue for major banks today. As the number of customers using credit cards steadily grows, defaults on credit card payments are also growing. Additionally, as it becomes easier to get a credit card even with a limited credit history, the risk of a large number of customers defaulting on a credit card payment only grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some interesting facts\n",
    "- With the economy growing again, the number of credit card payment deliquencies have also gone up touching 2.54% for the Q1 2018, the highest in 6 years (Source: Experian.com)\n",
    "- Credit card deliquencies for smaller banks touched 5.4% this year, the highest number since the financial crisis of 2008-09, suggesting that smaller banks are at a greater risk than their global counterparts (source EPM Macro Research)\n",
    "- credit card default information if available - impact of customer defaults on credit cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After the financial crisis of 2008-09, banks made it difficult to obtain a loan as they becaome more alert in identifying and classifying non-performing loans, but that is slowly changing as the economy soars again and banks are making it easier to obtain a line of credit. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## <u>Objective</u>\n",
    "This study was undertaken by me on behalf of the bank. The objective, for the bank, is to be able to identify clients who can potentially default on their credit card payment. The bank has a large amount of customer data but for reasons related to privacy concerns, only a limited list of features is available to us to perform the analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our objective is to build a model, based on the data provided by the bank, which predicts with maximum accuracy, which customers will default on their payment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following the analysis as well as decifing on a model to use for the prediction, the bank can then take a number of measures to ensure or increase the chances of payments or prepare for delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <u>Data Set Information</u>\n",
    "- As obtained from the data source: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients]\n",
    "Below is the actual text of the dataset from the source.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This research employed a binary variable, default payment (Yes = 1, No = 0), as the response variable. This study reviewed the literature and used the following 23 variables as explanatory variables:-\n",
    "\n",
    ">X1: Amount of the given credit (NT dollar): it includes both the individual consumer credit and his/her family (supplementary) credit. \n",
    "\n",
    ">X2: Gender (1 = male; 2 = female). \n",
    "\n",
    ">X3: Education (1 = graduate school; 2 = university; 3 = high school; 4 = others). \n",
    "\n",
    ">X4: Marital status (1 = married; 2 = single; 3 = others). \n",
    "\n",
    ">X5: Age (year). \n",
    "\n",
    ">X6 - X11: History of past payment. We tracked the past monthly payment records (from April to September, 2005) as follows: X6 = the repayment status in September, 2005;\n",

    ". . .;X11 = the repayment status in April, 2005.\n",
    "\n",

    "*It is important to note that the data is almost 15 years old. 15 years ago, banks had a much limited amount of information about customers and their spending habits as compared to today and perhaps models created today with the additional information will be able to predict better*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Remark on data quality\n",
    "This data set is very clean and has very few errors and missing values. It would be safe to assume that the data set was cleaned before being poseted on the source.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <u>Methodology</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective and Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the bank is to identify the customers who are most likely to default based on their previous payment and billing history, as well as some demographic information. The customers who are most likely to default can be approached in many ways using a default prevention campaign which could do the following:-\n",
    " - Approached with reminder emails/text messages/phone calls to remind them of their minimum payment due and balance, well before their next payment\n",
    " - Approached with special emails with helpful information about controlling credit card debt\n",
    " - For customers who have very large balances, will be approached with special schemes to reduce thier debt\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step will be to identify the customers who are most likely to default. This is a binary classification problem with 1 representing that the customer will default, and 0 representing a customer who will not default. Since the model will never be 100% accurate or precise everytime, we need to consider the errors in our calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four possibilities for each and every customer classified as a defaulter(1) or non-defaulter(0)\n",
    "\n",
    "- i) Customer is a non-defaulter(0) and is correctly classified as a non-defaulter(0). Also known as  <i>True Negative</i>.\n",
    "- ii) Customer is a defaulter(1) and is incorrectly classified as a non-defaulter(0). Also known as  <b>False Negative</b>.\n",
    "- iii) Customer is a defaulter(1) and is correctly classified as a defaulter(1). Also known as <i>True Positive</i>.\n",
    "- iv) Customer is a non-defaulter(0) and is incorrectly classified as a defaulter(1). Also known as <b>False Positive</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the average cost for running the default prevention campaign is <b>C</b> and the average revenue recovered from each customer is <b>R</b>, the bank has to minimize <b>C</b> and maximize <b>R</b>.\n",

    "The False Negatives and the False Positives result in loss of revenue in some form. All the revenue is lost in case of a false negative and there is an extra cost of the campaign which gets reduced from the revenue, in case of a false positive. The bank can afford to have false positives, because the bank still earns some revenue in that case but in case of false negatives, the bank loses all the possible revenue. False negatives need to be minimized. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Import and Cleaning\n",
    "The data was imported using the Pandas package and the read_csv method. The data set is a csv file. Before importing the data, the columns were renamed in the csv file itself. As you can notice, the columns had the X1, X2,X3...nomenclature. This was replaced with the actual column names for easier understanding of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The cleaning required was minimal due to the high quality of the data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploratory Data Analysis using Data Vizualizations\n",
    "Exploratory data analysis has been done by using the following packages:-\n",
    " - matplotlib for graphs and charts related to the predictive models\n",
    " - seaborn for exploratory data analysis\n",
    " \n",
    "matplotlib has been used more extensively as seaborn resulted in slower rendering of the graphs because of the size of the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Selection and Feature Engineering\n",
    "The dataset is financial data with a large number of parameters - 23 in total. Some of the variables cannot be broken down further due to their fundamental nature: age, gender, marital status, education etc. The other variables related to the payment are also , more or less, non modifyable. However, this doesnt mean that featre engineering is not possible or required in this scenario. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to finalize a model, I began working without any feature engineering and developing a model based on the present data. \n",
    "Once the model performance is analysed, I began working on some feature engineering (mentioned later in the report) to see how it impacts the model's performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Models \n",
    "Since this is a classification problem in supervised learning, I chose the following models.\n",
    "\n",
    "   #### *Logistic Regression*\n",
    "   \n",
    "   #### *K-Nearest Neighbours*\n",
    "   \n",
    "   #### *Decision Tree Classification*\n",
    "   \n",
    "   #### *Random Forest*\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "### Model Evaluation\n",
    "Model evaluation is done based on the following parameters:-\n",
    "\n",
    " - Accuracy\n",
    " - ROC curve\n",
    " - Precision\n",
    " - Recall\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy of the models is not vitally important in this scenario because precision and recall are more important because they consider false positives (precision) and false negatives (recall) in their calculations which are two values we are trying to minimize. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our objective is to reduce the number of false negatives as much as possible. To achive this, different probability thresholds have been tried for different models. The best one is identified based on the the minimum number of false positives and false negatives. \n",

    "\n",
    "This has been done to identify the impact of feature engineering on such a data set. The other purpose is to also show the impact of feature engineering on methods and whether it makes any difference in such a data set. This understanding will help save time on similar data sets or if similar features are added to the data set. \n",

    "\n",

    "Precision here would be defined as the number of correctly classified values. Its also important to note that we will have two precision values - one for 0 or non-defaulters or True Neatives and one for 1 or defaulters or True Positives. Our aim should be a high precision value for both. A model with a high precision value for 1, will be preffered if it also has a high precision value for 0.\n",

    "Based on the observations of these tests, we will conclude which model is the best for this scenario. \n",
